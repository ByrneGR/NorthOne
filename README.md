**SEO/SEM**

    * Relevant and eye catching title tags with React Helmet
    * Detailed and engaging meta descriptions
    * Organized headers with only one H1 per page

    * Keyword analysis with sites like SEM Rush to identify high volume/less competitive keywords to add to our site and rank for
    * More organic content to rank for popular search terms (ex: “how to file an SBA Loan”)

**Measurement**
* Implemented
    * Used Google Tag Manager to set up event tracking for Google Analytics and Mixpanel
    * Setup goal tracking and goal values in Google Analytics for 3 goals
        1. Greater than 5 Seconds on the Page - is the site and its content hooking users and preventing high bounce rates, which are especially common on ad platforms?
        2. CTA Button Click - Is the value proposition convincing enough to make users take the first step towards conversion, clicking the call-to-action and opening the form
        3. Form Submission - Is the form experience seamless and does it encourage users to take the final step and convert
    * Setup campaign tracking with UTMs in Google Analytics
    * Set up Segment and Google Analytics/Mixpanel integrations 
* Future Ideas
    * Server-side tagging instead of client-side tagging
        * Faster load times to increase goal conversion rates and reduce bounce rates
        * Better data quality without adblockres
        * More secure customer data
    * Downstream tracking
        * Setting up reports to view post-conversion data by lead source (ex: looking at customer lifetime value by channel instead of solely cost per conversion to ensure we’re delivering the biggest return on ad spend)
