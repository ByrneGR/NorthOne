Thank you for the opportunity to apply for this position. Below are notes on the project as well as ideas for future initiatives.

Backend: Ruby on Rails\
Frontend: React/Redux\
Hosting: Heroku

**SEO/SEM**
* Implemented
    * Relevant and eye catching title tags with React Helmet
    * Detailed and engaging meta descriptions
    * Organized headers with only one H1 per page
* Future ideas
    * Keyword analysis with sites like SEM Rush to identify high volume/less competitive keywords to add to our site and rank for
    * More organic content to rank for popular search terms (ex: “how to file an SBA Loan”)

**Measurement**
* Implemented
    * Used Google Tag Manager to set up event tracking for Google Analytics and Mixpanel
    * Setup goal tracking and goal values in Google Analytics for 3 goals
        1. Greater than 5 Seconds on the Page - is the site and its content hooking users and preventing high bounce rates, which are especially common on ad platforms?
        2. CTA Button Click - Is the value proposition convincing enough to make users take the first step towards conversion, clicking the call-to-action and opening the form
        3. Form Submission - Is the form experience seamless and does it encourage users to take the final step and convert
    * Setup campaign tracking with UTMs in Google Analytics
    * Set up Segment and Google Analytics/Mixpanel integrations 
* Future Ideas
    * Server-side tagging instead of client-side tagging
        * Faster load times to increase goal conversion rates and reduce bounce rates
        * Better data quality without adblockres
        * More secure customer data
    * Downstream tracking
        * Setting up reports to view post-conversion data by lead source (ex: looking at customer lifetime value by channel instead of solely cost per conversion to ensure we’re delivering the biggest return on ad spend)
        
**Performance Analysis**

* Funnel Tracking with Mixpanel
    * Insights:
        * 
        * 43% conversion from page view to CTA Click
        * 33% conversion from CTA Click to Form Submission
    * Future Ideas
        * More informative content on spash page to educate and retain users on site
            * Competitor Analysis Chart to show benefits of NorthOne vs big banks, other digital banks
            * Promotional deals to drive urgency - “For a limited time only, new NorthOne accounts receive $100!"
        * A/B testing different stages of funnel
            * Copy tests
            * Design tests
            * Form length tests
* Campaign/Source Tracking with Google Analytics
    *  Insights
        * 
            * Facebook driving highest conversion rate, but lowest volume - increase budgets there
            * LinkedIn has the highest bounce rate at 50%, audit targeting/placements to make sure we’re reaching a quality audience
    * Future Ideas
        * Passing downstream conversion data to ad platforms for optimization
            * Ex: Build lookalike audience on Facebook based on a seed list of our highest value customers instead of all customers
        * Dynamic landing pages based on audiences - different page for small business owners vs freelancers. Copy based on keywords targeted in SEM.
        * Reducing page load speeds for landing pages
